        <h2>Sarah's Favorite Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dance</li>
            <p>I started dancing when I was three years old. I competed when I lived in Boston, however, dancing has slowly faded out since moving to Sweden. It is not as big here and also I haven't had as much time for it.</p>
            <li>Painting</li>
            <p>Painting is also something I have enjoyed since a very young age. Almost all the walls are covered in my paintings at home.</p>
            <li>Drawing</li>
            <p>I like painting more than drawing, but it is also fun to draw and doodle small things when I'm bored.</p>
            <li>Playing pool</li>
            <p>Maybe not a hobby, but I like to play with my friends when we find the time.</p>
